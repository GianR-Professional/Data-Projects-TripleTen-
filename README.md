# Data-Projects (TripleTen)
Attached here is just a sample of my various projects I completed over the course of my TripleTen studies, which also include the other two Integrated Projects I made.

Some of these projects include:

* **Sprint 4 Project** — The Sprint 4 Project where I used Streamlit to create a working web application dashboard. After a fitful start, I managed to succeed on my second attempt.
* **Integrated Project I** — This is the first of three integrated projects I did with TripleTen, which analyzed video game platform and game sales to help determine advertising campaigns for an online store.
* **Integrated Project II** — This is the second of three integrated projects I did with TripleTen, which was far more complex and involved creating a machine learning model for the gold mining sector.
* **Integrated Project III** — This is the last of three integrated projects I did with TripleTen, which I developed a viable work plan from start to finish, then used it for developing a model that could help a telecoms company in retaining customers.
* **Sprint 12 Project** — This was another project for TripleTen, in which I developed a model for a car company looking to creat an app to attract customers.
* **Sprint 13 Project** — This was another project for TripleTen, in which I developed a model for a taxi service looking to predict orders for the next hour at any given moment.
  
The others will slowly be added as time goes on, to provide a complete picture of my progress.
