# Data-Projects (TripleTen)
Attached here is just a sample of my various projects I completed over the course of my TripleTen studies, which also include the other two Integrated Projects I made.

Some of these projects include:

* **Project-4_Take-2** (in a separate repository) - The Sprint 4 Project where I used Streamlit to create a working web application dashboard. After a fitful start, I managed to succeed on my second attempt.
* **Integrated Project I** -This is the first of three integrated projects I did with TripleTen, which analyzed video game platform and game sales to help determine advertising campaigns for an online store.
* **Integrated Project II** -This is the second of three integrated projects I did with TripleTen, which was far more complex and involved creating a machine learning model for the gold mining sector.
* **Integrated Project III** -This is the last of three integrated projects I did with TripleTen, which I developed a viable work plan from start to finish, then used it for developing a model that could help a telecoms company in retaining customers.
