# Data-Projects (TripleTen)
Attached here is just a sample of my various projects I completed over the course of my TripleTen studies, which also include the other two Integrated Projects I made.

Some of these projects include:

**Project-4_Take-2** - The Sprint 4 Project where I used Streamlit to create a working web application dashboard. After a fitful start, I managed to succeed on my second attempt.
**Integrated Project I** -This is the first of three integrated projects I did with TripleTen, which analyzed user/taxi traffic in Chicago for a web app.
