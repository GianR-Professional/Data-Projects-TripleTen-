This is the second of three integrated projects I did with TripleTen, which was far more complex and involved creating a machine learning model for the gold mining sector.

Both the Python code and the corresponding datasets are placed here (of which there are three):

* **gold_recovery_train** - the training dataset
* **gold_recovery_test** - the testing dataset
* **gold_recovery_full** - the full dataset (which is the main source of the other two)
