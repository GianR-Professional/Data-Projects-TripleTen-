This is the last of three integrated projects I did with TripleTen, which I developed a viable work plan from start to finish, then used it for developing a model that could help a telecoms company in retaining customers.

There are three parts of this:
* **the Databases**, which are split into five, which are data used for this project
* **the Work Plan**, which was devised by myself to help inform my coding and develop a plan
* **the Code and Report**, which implements the work plan and shows the results.
